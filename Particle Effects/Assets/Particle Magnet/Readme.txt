Instructions on how to use the Particle Magnet:
> Add Particle Magnet component to any GameObject that has a particle system
> Configure its attraction force
> Test it out with the Debug & Test features
> Reference it by script and use the Activate method, filling in the required parameters

No edits to the particle system the component is attached to are required, because the script
handles everything by itself.
